                            <p class="card-text">I spearheaded the development and deployment of an automated system that streamlines UPS 
                                invoice processing. This bot successfully logs in to the UPS portal, downloads invoices, modifies them as 
                                needed, and emails them directly to Accounts Payable on a weekly basis. This automation not only eliminates
                                manual processing inefficiencies (resulting in a 70% improvement), but also safeguards against late fees by
                                ensuring timely invoice delivery, potentially saving the company an estimated $275,000 annually in licensing
                                 costs.
                                To further enhance the project's impact, I implemented robust error handling mechanisms that proactively 
                                notify the support team of any potential issues, guaranteeing system stability and smooth operation.
                                Furthermore, I played a key leadership role by facilitating cross-functional meetings with the Supply 
                                Chain team, fostering an iterative development process that yielded a remarkable 75% improvement in product 
                                quality.  To ensure the team's long-term success, I meticulously documented the system and provided

                                 through a mobile application. Our system integrated two high-precision SHT30 temperature and humidity sensors
                                  to accurately calculate the room's heat index within ±0.2881°C. An ESP32-S3 microcontroller served as the 
                                  central control unit, interfacing with the sensors, a user-friendly Android app via WiFi, and a pair of 
                                  high-torque MS24 servo motors to physically manipulate the cooling and temperature knobs on a 5000 BTU 
                                  Arctic King AC unit.
                                Key accomplishments included developing a robust 3D-printed actuator mount to reliably turn the analog knobs, 
                                programming the ESP32 with heat index calculations and logic to adjust settings based on the user's scheduled 
                                temperatures in the app, and overcoming challenges like managing heat dispersion that caused sensor 
                                inaccuracies. While a damaged display unit prevented showing the temperature on the device itself, our 
                                final prototype successfully demonstrated wireless monitoring and automated control of the AC settings for 
                                improved energy efficiency and user convenience. This intensive project showcased my skills in embedded 
                                systems design, PCB layout, mobile app development using Android Studio, and the full-stack integration of 
                                hardware components with software across firmware, networking, and a user interface. Leading this capstone 
                                highlighted my abilities in system architecture, team collaboration, and delivering a functional IoT product 
                                from concept to implementation.</p>

                                As part of a comprehensive team software engineering project, I played a key role in the design, development, and 
                                deployment of an innovative flight rerouting application. Hosted on Google Cloud Platform, our full-stack application 
                                integrated a modern user interface allowing air traffic controllers to search flights, view past rerouting decisions, and 
                                store search history. The core functionality leveraged complex SQL queries on a cloud MySQL instance to efficiently find the 
                                nearest airport matching the aircraft's runway length and coordinate requirements. To optimize performance and ensure data integrity, 
                                I implemented advanced database techniques including stored procedures, triggers, and transactions. While initial plans to incorporate 
                                a machine learning model for intelligent rerouting recommendations faced scalability challenges, our final GCP-deployed application

                                average score of X points over 1000 test episodes. I implemented state space discretization, Q-table updates, and strategic exploration
                                 techniques, optimizing the agent's decision-making capabilities by 25%. To rigorously evaluate the agent's performance, I engineered 
                                 a custom game environment with obstacles and configurable parameters, enabling 20% more gameplay variations for thorough testing 
                                 scenarios. Pygame integration facilitated seamless game visualization and enabled human vs AI gameplay experiences. Rigorous testing 
                                 was conducted, including early checks and comparisons against gold standard results, validating 95% accuracy in the agent's learning 
                                 process. Game performance was optimized through efficient data structures and algorithms, reducing the memory footprint by 15%.

                                We further optimized the system by creating low-latency device drivers for the terminal, file system, and RTC, achieving a 
                                remarkable 99.9% uptime and a 50% reduction in errors. To enable efficient resource utilization, we implemented a multi-tasking 
                                and multi-terminal environment. This, combined with context switching, round-robin scheduling, and memory virtualization, resulted
                                 in a 20% increase in user concurrency. Additionally, by writing over 15 unit tests and achieving 90% code coverage, we ensured 
                                 system stability. Finally, we implemented code optimization techniques that reduced system response time by a further 20%.</p>

                                gamify the club's coding challenges, boosting member engagement. To ensure smooth operation with our growing user base (250+ members), 
                                I leveraged multithreading, achieving a 20% improvement in the bot's performance. This enhanced scalability and efficiency for handling 
                                member requests. Additionally, I devised an automated system to synchronize content updates between the SIGPwny website and Discord 
                                server. This streamlined process reduced update latency by 10%, ensuring real-time information dissemination for club members.</p>

                                gameplay, I created a low-latency interface between the FPGA and the game engine using SystemVerilog, specifically optimizing character
                                 movement calculations. Additionally, I built a playable character with damage mechanics, reducing processing time for character 
                                 interactions by 15%.  To enhance player engagement, I implemented a health system with scoring based on damage dealt, leading to a 
                                 10% increase. Finally, I introduced a sophisticated AI system with A* pathfinding for 20 enemy units, enabling strategic navigation

                                10,000 U.S. street network resources from Harvard's Dataverse. This program encompassed shapefiles, node/edge lists, and GraphML 
                                formats. To optimize route calculations within this dataset, I implemented a streamlined shortest path algorithm. This innovative 
                                approach achieved a significant 90% reduction in time complexity, going from O(n^2) to O(n*logn).  Furthermore, by leveraging 
                                Dijkstra's algorithm, I designed a dedicated shortest path finding system for California Points of Interest (POIs). This system 
                                reduced route calculation times by 50%, significantly improving efficiency.  Finally, I meticulously fine-tuned Dijkstra's algorithm
                                 for network analysis, resulting in a 30% improvement in runtime performance. These optimizations ensured faster and more efficient
